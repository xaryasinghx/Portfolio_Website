# Portfolio Website README

Welcome to my portfolio website repository!

## Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The website is built to be responsive, user-friendly, and easy to navigate across devices. It highlights key sections such as an "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact" page, with links to my social media and resume.

The goal is to provide a professional online presence and serve as a digital resume that employers, recruiters, or collaborators can refer to.
